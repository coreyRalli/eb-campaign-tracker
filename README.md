# Earthborne Rangers Digital Campaign Tracker

A simple campaign tracker for [Earthborne Rangers](https://earthbornegames.com/). You can find it in action [here](https://coreyRalli.github.io/eb-campaign-tracker/).

At the moment only covers the vanilla "Lure Of The Valley" campaign. Uses LocalStorage to store data, though there is the option to save a campaign file to import across different devices.

I am in no way connected with Earthborne Games, I just think the game is neat.

## TODO

- Add "Legacy Of The Ancestors" & "Spire In Bloom" path terrains and weather + expanded campaign days
- Manually selectable weather
- Multiple Campaign Support
- Cleanup styling and selectors
- Add Light Mode UI
- Combobox for rewards
