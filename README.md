# Earthborne Rangers Digital Campaign Tracker

A simple campaign tracker for [Earthborne Rangers](https://earthbornegames.com/). You can find it in action [here](https://coreyRalli.github.io/eb-campaign-tracker/).

At the moment only covers the vanilla "Lure Of The Valley" campaign. Uses LocalStorage to store data, though there is the option to save a campaign file to import across different devices.

I am in no way connected with Earthborne Games, I just think the game is neat.
