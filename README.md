# Earthborne Rangers Digital Campaign Tracker

A campaign tracker for [Earthborne Rangers](https://earthbornegames.com/the-game/). You can see it in action [here](https://coreyRalli.github.io/eb-campaign-tracker/).

Supports Lure Of The Valley (including Spire In Bloom & extended campaign days) and Legacy Of The Ancestors. Uses LocalStorage to store data, though there is the option to save a campaign file to import across different devices.

I am in no way connected with Earthborne Games, I just think the game is neat.

## TODO

- Manually selectable weather
- Multiple Campaign Support
- Cleanup styling and selectors
- Add Light Mode UI
- Combobox for rewards
- Decklists
